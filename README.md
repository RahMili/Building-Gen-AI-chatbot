# Building-Gen-AI-chatbot
This repository contains the code to build a chatbot using GCP Vertex AI LLM, that ingests documents and answers user queries with the information from the document, 

This is a standalone notebook for google colab, you can modularize it in the form of a project with a directory structure but I have not done that here, the code will work as it is. But do make sure to install google cloud sdk on your local and set it up.

Steps to run:
- Upload this notebook in your google colab.
- The steps to run the notebook itself are mentioned within the notebook, so do not worry
- And run this only on colab, if you want to run it on local machine you need to install google cloud sdk and set it up first, then you're good to go.
